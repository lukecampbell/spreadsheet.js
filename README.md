spreadsheet.js
===

Based on the code found here: [georgenava.appspot.com/demo/spreadsheet.html](http://georgenava.appspot.com/demo/spreadsheet.html)

Provides a simple (and probably terrible) way to manage a table as a spreadsheet in HTML and Javascript.

Luke Campbell ported the code but the original author isn't posted in the original source code. =(

If it's any consolation I got the page from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11346433/style-an-html-table-to-look-like-a-spreadsheet-like-google-docs)
